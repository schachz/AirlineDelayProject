# AirlineDelayProject

# Introduction:
This project is an analysis of airline data using R code. The dataset used in this project contains information about flight delays and cancellations in the United States. The purpose of this project is to explore the data and identify trends and patterns in flight delays and cancellations.

# Goals:
The main goals of this project are to:

-Understand the extent and frequency of flight delays and cancellations in the United States for different airlines.

-Identify factors that contribute to flight delays and cancellations, such as airlines, airports, and weather conditions.

-Create visualizations to illustrate the trends and patterns in flight delays and cancellations.

-Develop models to predict flight delays and cancellations based on the available data.

# Methodologies:
To achieve these goals, the project will follow these steps:

-Import the dataset into R and clean the data as necessary.

-Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in flight delays and cancellations.

-Use statistical methods to determine the factors that contribute to flight delays and cancellations.

-Create visualizations to illustrate the trends and patterns in flight delays and cancellations.

-Develop machine learning models to predict flight delays and cancellations based on the available data.
